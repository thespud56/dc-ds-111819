    "# Functions Practice: Building a Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you'll create a simple calculator which can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division depending on the user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a while loop \n",
    "- Incorporate input/output functionality in code to allow for user interaction  \n",
    "- Declare and use a function with arguments \n",
    "- Use break and continue to add control flow to a while loop \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach \n",
    "\n",
    "- User chooses the desired operation. Options 1, 2, 3, and 4 are valid options for operations   \n",
    "- Two numbers are taken and an `if…elif…else` branching is used to execute a particular section \n",
    "- Using functions `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, and `divide()` evaluate respective operations \n",
    "- The code should handle exceptions and must return **\"invalid input\"** when an unexpected character is given in the input (anything other than 1 - 4) \n",
    "\n",
    "## Example interface\n",
    "Here is the interface you are expected to build. Don't worry if it is not 100% the same as what is shown. Focus more on the getting the logic correct at this stage. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Please select an operation:\n",
    "1. Add\n",
    "2. Subtract\n",
    "3. Multiply\n",
    "4. Divide\n",
    "\n",
    "Select operations from 1, 2, 3, 4 : 1\n",
    "Enter first number : 20\n",
    "Enter second number : 13\n",
    "20 + 13 = 33\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating arithmetic functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create four functions, one for each arithmetic operation which will perform the required operation and return the resulting value as shown below:"
