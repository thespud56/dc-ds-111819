## let's play with cluster_std and try to find number of clusters

## let's instantiate kmeans algorithm
## don't forget to check its parameters
k_means = KMeans(n_clusters= 5)

# dont forget to fit the model!
k_means.fit(X)

## we make a prediction for each point
y_hat = k_means.predict(X)

## we can access the coordinates of the cluster centers by cluster_centers_ method
cl_centers = k_means.cluster_centers_

print(cl_centers)
## note that the colors are different - Is this a problem?
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y_hat, s = 25);


## also let's mark the cluster centers too.
plt.scatter(cl_centers[:, 0], cl_centers[:, 1], c='black', s=100);
